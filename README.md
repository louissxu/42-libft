#42-libft

Prior to this commit is the state of libft at time of submission to Moulinette.

Final grade 125/100. (Completed with all bonuses).

From this point on, modifications have been made for clarity and improvements in form. As well as added functions for extension. However, they have not been run through the Moulinette autograder so there is no guarantee that it does not fail the Moulinette's tests.
