# 42-libft

### Final Grade

**125/100**

Submitted and passed Moulinette with all bonuses.

Repository state at time of submission is https://github.com/louissxu/42-libft/tree/c4776da0dfacf07917b00fc25eb5d56d5d5dd59e

Further changes have since been made to add further functionality or improve clarity of functions that have already been submitted. For future students using this repository as a guide, changes after this point to the graded functions still pass publically available unit tests and should be satisfactory; however they have not been resubmitted to the Moulinette. Therefore there is no guarantee that they will pass the cannonical test set (though it would be very surprising if they didn't given the external test sets are very comprehensive).

### Overview

A 42 project. An exercise in the reimplementation of a number of C standard library functions. Bonus included the implementation of a linked list covering the creation of a structure and type definition together with basic functions for manipulation of the linked list. For further information and full list of functions, see subject.pdf.
